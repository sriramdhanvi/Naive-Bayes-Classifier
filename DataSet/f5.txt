The logic of economic integration will ensure that the remote regions of both the countries that border each other — Xinjiang, Tibet and Yunnan in China and Kashmir, Sikkim and the Northeast in India — will be brought closer to each other as well as regional markets. At present trade between the two countries is at the national level. Political sensitivities are preventing natural economic cooperation between neighbouring regions in the two countries. This is both unwise and unsustainable from an economic standpoint. Both countries now have an interest in developing their frontier regions bordering each other. Border trade and transit trade are essential to improve the living standards of people across the Sino-Indian boundary. 

Trans-frontier economic cooperation that will restore historic trading routes, access roads and pilgrimage rights will create a new framework in which the boundary issue can be settled. Delineating a linear border will be less difficult if the two sides maintain the focus on the trans-boundary interests of communities. The paradigm shift in Sino-Indian relations will then be complete.
