The 'likefile' is supposed to contain all the words found int doucuments(files) classified as "like". Similarly for the 'dislike' file.

The 'testfile' contains the content of the document to be tested.

The 'DataSet' folder contains 6 files from f1 to f6.

As this implemantation requires, these files are given prior classificationa as follows :

f1 : like

f2 : dislike

f3 : like

f4 : dislike

f5 : dislike

f6 : like

So all the documents which are supposed to be classified must be placed in either f1,f3 or f6, and the other documents are to be placed in the remaining files.

Please Note that these files contain certain content. files f1,f3 and f6 contain extracts from articles on 'cricket'.

files f2,f4 and f5 contain extracts from articles on 'international politics'.

The testfile has been initialized to contain data on 'cricket'.

These data can be used to check the correctness of the algorithm. However, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATHS TO THESE FILES HAVE 

BEEN HARD CODED ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE ALGORITHM WAS IMPLEMENTED, SO THESE PATHS MUST BE CHANGED TO ENSURE 

PROPER EXECUTION.

The program is supposed to return "like(cricket)". On getting the output other-wise, please consider deleting the 

'testfile' completely and reloading it with the data. (refer to section 3 of the report for the same)
